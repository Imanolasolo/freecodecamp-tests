// Convert the characters &, <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their 
//corresponding HTML entities.

// Hints 

// You can use regular Expressions however I didnâ€™t in this case.

// You will benefit from a chart with all the html entities so you
//know which ones are the right ones to put.

// You should separate the string and work with each character to convert the right ones and
//then join everything back up.

    // Split by character to avoid problems.
  
    var temp = str.split("");
  
    // Since we are only checking for a few HTML elements, use a switch
